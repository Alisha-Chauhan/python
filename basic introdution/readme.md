# What is Python?
Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.

# It is used for:

web development (server-side),
software development,
mathematics,
system scripting.


# Execute Python Syntax
Python syntax can be executed by writing directly in the Command Line:


# Python Indentation
Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.

Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.

Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

# Python Variables
In Python, variables are created when you assign a value to it:
Python has no command for declaring a variable.
You will learn more about variables in the Python Variables chapter.

###Variables are containers for storing data values.



# Comments
Python has commenting capability for the purpose of in-code documentation.

Comments start with a #, and Python will render the rest of the line as a comment:
The shortcut for making comments all the lines at one touch is: ctrl + /

# characterstices of comments
Comments can be used to explain Python code.

Comments can be used to make the code more readable.

Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.

# multiple lines comment

Python will ignore string literals that are not assigned to a variable, you can add a multiline string (triple quotes) in your code, and place your comment inside it:

# casting
If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.

###Case-Sensitive
Variable names are case-sensitive

# Variable Names
A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables:
A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
A variable name cannot start with a number
A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.
